    "## Lab: Demonstrating the Born Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Born rule** states that measurement probabilities are given by the squared amplitudes of a quantum state.  \n",
    "For a qubit $|S\\rangle = a|0\\rangle + b|1\\rangle$, with the normalization constraint $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, the probability of recording the classical result **0** is $P(0) = |a|^2$, and the probability of recording **1** is $P(1) = |b|^2$.  \n",
    "In this lab we prepare a qubit state for chosen values of $a$ and $b$, measure it repeatedly, and compare the observed frequencies with these predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Prepare a single-qubit state as $|S\\rangle = 0.6|0\\rangle + 0.8|1\\rangle$.  \n",
    "Simulate repeated measurements in the computational (Z) basis and compare the observed frequencies with the theoretical probabilities predicted by the Born rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "- Theoretical probabilities calculated from the given amplitudes.  \n",
    "- A dictionary of observed measurement counts.  \n",
    "- A dictionary of observed measurement probabilities.  \n",
    "- A probability distribution plot showing measured vs. theoretical probabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The results should confirm that the empirical frequencies are close to the probabilities predicted by the Born rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenge\n",
    "- Repeat the experiment with different values of $a$ and $b$ and compare the results.  \n",
    "- Increase the number of shots (e.g., 10,000) to see how the observed frequencies converge more closely to the theoretical values.  \n",
    "- Add a numerical check by calculating the relative error or confidence interval for each probability.  "
