    "## QCLab: Kitaev’s Phase Estimation — QPE\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we explore **Kitaev’s Phase Estimation** algorithm, a fundamental tool in quantum computing for extracting eigenphases of unitary operators. Suppose a unitary operator $U$ has an eigenstate $\\lvert u \\rangle$ with eigenvalue  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "U \\lvert u \\rangle = e^{2 \\pi i \\phi} \\lvert u \\rangle ,\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "where $\\phi \\in [0,1)$ is the normalized phase (fraction of a full $2\\pi$ rotation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of phase estimation is to determine $\\phi$ by using controlled applications of $U^{2^k}$ and measurements on control qubits. For $n$ control qubits, we obtain an $n$-bit binary estimate of $\\phi$.  \n",

    "### Task\n",
    "                 \n",
    "- Based on the general QPE circuit design, the task is to implement a 2-qubit QPE circuit for the single-qubit phase gate $P(\\theta)$, using the eigenstate $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ as the target qubit, where $\\theta = 2\\pi\\phi$.\n",
    "- To calculate the phase angle, use the argmax (grid snap) method. The algorithm takes the measurement counts from a QPE run, finds the most likely control register outcome, converts it into an integer $y$, and returns the normalized phase estimate $\\hat{\\phi} = y/2^n.$<br>\n",
    "Thus, the argmax method provides a discrete approximation of the true phase $\\phi$, accurate to within $\\pm1/2^n$.                \n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- A plot of the QPE circuit.\n",
    "- The true and estimated values of $\\phi$, reported both in normalized form ($\\phi \\in [0,1)$) and in radians ($\\theta = 2\\pi\\phi$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend your circuit to 3 control qubits to increase the precision of phase estimation.  \n",
    "- Replace the $P(\\theta)$ gate with another unitary operator $U$ (for example, a $Z$-rotation) and verify that the circuit still extracts the correct eigenphase.  \n",
    "- Add another function for calculating the phase from the measurement counts using the **circular mean** method instead of argmax. \n"
