# QC-Labs
These labs introduce core quantum computing concepts through code-based exercises using Qiskit. Students build and simulate quantum circuits, visualize results, and explore quantum behavior through practical examples.

[Lab 01](Lab%2001%20-%20quantum%20circuit.ipynb): Building and Simulating a Simple Quantum Circuit<br>
[Lab 02](Lab%2002%20-%20QRNG.ipynb): Quantum Random Number Generation with Hadamard Gates
