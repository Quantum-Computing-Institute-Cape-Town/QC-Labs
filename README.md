# QC-Labs
These labs introduce core quantum computing concepts through code-based exercises using Qiskit. Students build and simulate quantum circuits, visualize results, and explore quantum behavior through practical examples.

[Lab 01](Lab%2001%20-%20quantum%20circuit.ipynb): Building and Simulating a Simple Quantum Circuit<br>
[Lab 02](Lab%2002%20-%20QRNG.ipynb): Quantum Random Number Generation with Hadamard Gates<br>
[Lab 03](Lab%2003%20-%20Bell%20state.ipynb): Creating and Measuring a Bell State<br>
[Lab 04](Lab%2004%20-%20Conditional%20Bell%20State%20Encoding.ipynb): Conditional Bell State Encoding<br>
[Lab 05](Lab%2005%20-%20Deutsch–Jozsa%20algorithm.ipynb): Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm<br>
[Lab06](Lab06%20-%20Bernstein–Vazirani%20algorithm.ipynb): Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm<br>
[Lab 07](Lab%2007%20-%20Simons%20algorithm.ipynb): Simon's algorithm<br>
[Lab 08](Lab%2008%20-%20Grover%20Search%20Algorithm.ipynb): Grover Search Algorithm.ipynb<br>

## Note
You can also load these examples into Google Colab by going to **File > Open notebook** and then selecting the **GitHub** tab. Enter the following URL to access the repository: `Quantum-Computing-Institute-Cape-Town/QC-Labs`.

Since Colab's default display behavior might not show all plots in a single cell, you may need to explicitly import the display library to force each plot to render. This ensures that all your plots appear, not just the last one.

```python
from IPython.display import display

# Assuming you have defined counts1 and counts2
hist1 = plot_histogram(counts1)
display(hist1)

hist2 = plot_histogram(counts2)
display(hist2)
```
