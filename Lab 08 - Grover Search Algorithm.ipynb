    "## Lab 08: Grover’s Search Algorithm – n‑Qubit Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover’s algorithm extracts a desired binary string from the superposition of all possible strings of the same length.  \n",
    "This can be interpreted as searching for the target item in an unsorted database of size $N$ using only $O(\\sqrt{N})$ queries, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search.  \n",
    "It works by amplifying the probability of the target state using repeated applications of the **oracle** (which marks the target by flipping its phase) and the **diffuser** (which performs inversion about the mean).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Design and run a Grover’s search circuit for an **n‑qubit system**, where $n$ is determined by the length of the user‑specified binary target string (e.g., `1011`).  \n",
    "The oracle should flip the phase of **only** the target state, and the diffuser should increase its probability amplitude.  \n",
    "For simplicity, use multi‑qubit controlled `mcx` gates when constructing the oracle and diffuser.  \n",
    "The algorithm should run for the optimal number of iterations calculated as:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{iterations} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\sqrt{2^n} \\right\\rfloor\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Output\n",
    "- Display the created Grover’s search quantum circuit.  \n",
    "- Show the probability distribution dictionary with the target state having the highest probability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenge\n",
    "- Modify the code to allow multiple marked states and adjust the number of Grover iterations accordingly.  \n",
    "- Compare results for different numbers of iterations to observe under‑rotation and over‑rotation effects.\n"
